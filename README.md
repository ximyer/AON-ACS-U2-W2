# Unit 2: Recursive Art 🎨

## Overview:
In this unit, students will learn/review recursion and use their knowledge to create visualizations.


### L-Systems:
Students will learn about L-Systems and implement and/or generate a set of production rules to create a visual effect

### Tasks:
- Continue reading chapter 8 in The Nature of Code about L-Systems. 
- Read two other good resources about L-Systems. Bourke and Santell.
- Create a new replit. 
- Choose an L-System to implement or design your own and both visually descript it using a “.draw” file and describe the production rules in a planning document (either “.txt” or “.md”)
- Develop an algorithm for drawing subsequent productions based on user interaction in pseudocode (e.g. “press a key for a new production”) and place it in your planning document.
- Implement
- Invite Mr.O to turn in the project and copy your replit link into your gradebook

## Result: 📸
